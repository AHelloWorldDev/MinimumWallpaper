# Minimum Wallpaper

## The Problem

**Q:** How do you set a solid color wallpaper on your Android device?

**A:** You use a tiny 1x1 pixel image with the pixel set to that color (Black, Pink, or #FF5678). Simple, fast, and memory-friendly.

This works on most Android devices (including Nexus devices and others that run stock Android). The system knows how to fill the entire screen with that one pixel, giving you a full solid color wallpaper.

However, there are some Android devices that give errors immediately after setting the 1x1 pixel image wallpaper: *Unfortunately, System UI has stopped* or *Unfortunately, Home has stopped*. Trying slightly larger image sizes (2x2, 3x3, 4x4) also fails. For some devices, you need [a 32x32 pixel image](https://github.com/AHelloWorldDev/MinimumWallpaper/issues/1) to finally get your color wallpaper working.

## The Test App

Trying to set a black or color wallpaper on your smartphone or tablet? Can your Android handle a 1x1 pixel image wallpaper? What is the minimum wallpaper size that works on your device? Minimum Wallpaper has been designed to answer these questions.

Although this tiny app has been created for testing purposes, it can successfully be used to set a black or color wallpaper on your Android device.
